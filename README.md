# Portal mod
This is a Minecraft mod that implements elements from [Portal](http://www.thinkwithportals.com) in [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net). This is not the other [portal gun mod](http://ichun.me/mods/portalgun/). It currently has:

- Hard-light bridges
- A portal gun that shoots portals that look fancy but don't actually do anything
- Lots of bugs
